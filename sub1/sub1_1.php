                    	<p>UNEP recognizes the intrinsic value of the environment in serving economic and
social needs and the  importance of enabling natural processes to proceed in a way that can
sustain these needs. It also recognizes that ecosystem health underpins
human well-being, and thus poverty eradication, and that the future of humanity is
inextricably linked to the planet’s life support systems, through the provision of
environmental goods and services.
These factors underpin the vision of UNEP and are explicitly recognized
in its goals for the medium-term strategy.</p>
						<p>Whereas the vision statement defines the long-term ambition of UNEP,
the medium-term strategy has a goal statement that expresses the focus of UNEP
for a specific period, 2014?2017. For this period, the key goal pursued
 by UNEP is to catalyse a transition towards low carbon, resource efficient and equitable
development based on the protection and sustainable use of ecosystem
services, coherent environmental governance and the reduction of environmental
risks for the well-being of current and future generations and the attainment of global
environmental goals in order to contribute to sustainable development.</p>
