                    <p>Following an extensive career focusing on environment and
development in government and international organizations,
Erik Solheim was elected to become Executive Director of the UN
Environment Programme (UNEP) on May 13, 2016.
Prior to joining UNEP, Solheim was the chair of the
Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the Organization
for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).

                    <p>As head of the DAC, which is the
main body of the world’s development donors, Solheim emphasized
the role of private sector and tax in development finance,
spearheading the
Sustainable Development Investment Partnership and
the Addis Tax Initiative.
Solheim also focused on the need to channel more aid to
least-developed countries, and bring new members and
partners to the DAC.
</p>
                    <p>
                    From 2007 to 2012, Solheim held the combined portfolio of
                    Norway’s Minister of the
                    Environment and International Development, and from
                    2005 to 2007 served as Minister of
                    International Development. This unique portfolio mixture allowed
                    him to bring a coherent approach to development and the environment.</p>

                    <p>During his time as Minister, Norwegian aid reached 1%,
the highest in the world.
Solheim also put into place the Nature Diversity Act, which
many consider to be Norway’s most important piece of environmental
legislation in the last 100 years.</p>

<p>The Norwegian Climate and Forest Initiative, in which Norway
cooperates closely with Brazil, Indonesia, Guyana and other
countries to conserve rainforests, was also established under Solheim.
This initiative provided critical input to the establishment of UN REDD,
the global coalition to reduce emissions from deforestation
and forest degradation in developing countries.</p>

lead peace efforts in Sri Lanka as Minister, and has
contributed to peace processes in Sudan, Nepal, Myanmar and
Burundi.</p>
