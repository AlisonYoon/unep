                        <h4>About REDD+</h4>
                          <p>Deforestation and forest degradation account for approximately 
17 per cent of carbon emissions, more than the entire global transportation 
sector and second only to the energy sector. It is now clear that in 
order to constrain the impacts of climate change within limits that society will 
reasonably be able to tolerate, global average temperatures must be 
stabilized within two degrees Celsius. This will be practically impossible to 
achieve without reducing emissions from the forest sector, in addition to 
other mitigation actions.
Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) 
is a mechanism developed by Parties to the United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). It creates a financial 
value for the carbon stored in forests by offering incentives for developing 
countries to reduce emissions from forested lands and invest in 
low-carbon paths to sustainable development. Developing countries 
would receive results-based payments for results-based actions. 
REDD+ goes beyond simply deforestation and forest degradation, and 
includes the role of conservation, sustainable management of forests 
and enhancement of forest carbon stocks.</p>

                          <h5>The Programme</h5>
                          <p>The United Nations Collaborative Programme on Reducing 
Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in Developing 
Countries was launched in 2008 and builds on the convening 
capacity and technical expertise of the Food and Agriculture 
Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the United Nations Development 
Programme (UNDP) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP).
​The overall development goal of the Programme is to reduce forest 
emissions and enhance carbon stocks in forests while contributing to 
national sustainable development.
The UN-REDD Programme supports nationally led REDD+ processes and 
promotes the informed and meaningful involvement of all stakeholders, 
including indigenous peoples and other forest-dependent communities, in 
the implementation of REDD+ activities agreed under the UNFCCC.
The Programme has expanded steadily since its establishment and over 60 
countries spanning Africa, Asia-Pacific and Latin America are now partners.</p>
						<p>We supports partner countries through:
-Direct support to the design and implementation of 
National REDD+ Programmes;
-Complementary tailored support to national REDD+ actions; and
-Technical capacity building support through sharing of expertise, 
common approaches, analyses, methodologies, tools, data, 
best practices and facilitated South-South knowledge sharing.</p>

                        <h4>How does REDD+ benefit developing
countries?</h4>

<p>Developing countries that meet UNFCCC REDD+
requirements (see box “Elements of UNFCCC Warsaw
Framework for REDD+”) will receive results-based
payments for verified emissions reductions. As such,
REDD+ creates an incentive for these countries to reduce
emissions from forests, and invest in low-carbon paths to
sustainable development.
By implementing REDD+ actions, countries will
contribute to conserving their national biodiversity and
to the global fight against climate change. In addition to
the environmental benefits, REDD+ also offers social and
economic benefits. Most recently, it is being integrated
into green economy strategies.
REDD+ is also a tool to realize achievement of the
transformative 2030 Agenda for Sustainable
Development adopted by world leaders in September
2015. The new agenda calls on countries to begin efforts
to achieve 17 Sustainable Development Goals over the
next 15 years. While REDD+ is directly linked to Climate
Action (goal 13), it can also play an important role
towards Responsible Consumption and Production (goal
12), Gender Equality (goal 5), Life on Land (goal 15), and
Decent Work and Economic Growth (goal 8) among
others.</p>

                        <h4>Why is REDD+ important?</h4>
                        <p>Deforestation and forest degradation have long been
recognized as significant sources of carbon emissions,
as trees store carbon and when they are destroyed this
carbon is released into the atmosphere contributing to
greenhouse gases that cause climate change.
As up to 11 per cent of carbon emissions are caused by
deforestation and forest degradation, it is important that
the reduction of these emissions is part of the global
plan to fight climate change. REDD+ is the identified
mechanism to do so.
In addition to their carbon storage role, forests are
valuable in many other ways. This includes water
regulation, soil protection, non-timber forest products
including food and fibre, climate regulation and
biodiversity. In fact, it is estimated that 1.6 billion people
depend on forests. As such, by conserving forests,
REDD+ offers a broad range of social, environmental and
economic benefits to developing countries and forest
communities.</p>
